You are an expert dental diagnostician analyzing a cropped dental image.

CLASSIFICATION TASK:
Carefully examine this dental image and identify what is shown. Then select the ONE most accurate class from this list:

TOOTH NUMBERS (0-31):
'11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18' (Upper right quadrant)
'21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28' (Upper left quadrant)
'31', '32', '33', '34', '35', '36', '37', '38' (Lower left quadrant)
'41', '42', '43', '44', '45', '46', '47', '48' (Lower right quadrant)

DENTAL CONDITIONS/FEATURES (32-43):
'amalgam filling' - Dark metallic silver/gray filling material
'calculus' - Hardened plaque deposits, usually yellow/brown
'fixed prosthesis' - Dental bridge or crown (artificial tooth structure)
'incisive papilla' - Small bump of tissue behind upper front teeth
'non-carious lesion' - Tooth damage not from decay (erosion, abrasion, etc.)
'palatine raphe' - Ridge line in center of palate roof
'staining or visible changes without cavitation' - Discoloration but no hole
'temporary restoration' - Temporary filling (often white/off-white)
'tongue' - Visible tongue tissue
'tooth coloured filling' - White/beige composite filling material
'visible changes with cavitation' - Decay with an actual hole/cavity
'visible changes with microcavitation' - Very small cavity starting to form

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. Is this a tooth? If yes, which tooth number based on position?
2. Is this a filling? If yes, what type (amalgam=dark, tooth-colored=white)?
3. Is this a dental condition? Look for decay, calculus, staining, etc.
4. Is this soft tissue? (tongue, incisive papilla, palatine raphe)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Respond with ONLY the class name from the list above. No explanation, no quotes, just the exact class name.

Examples:
- If you see a dark metallic filling → amalgam filling
- If you see yellow/brown deposits on tooth → calculus
- If you see a white/beige filling → tooth coloured filling
- If you see a natural tooth with no obvious pathology → appropriate tooth number (11-48)
- If you see decay with a hole → visible changes with cavitation

Return ONLY the class name.
