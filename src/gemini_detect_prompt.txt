You are an expert dental diagnostician with computer vision capabilities. Analyze this dental image and detect ALL visible dental features with MAXIMUM PRECISION.

CLASSES (0-43):
TEETH: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48
CONDITIONS: amalgam filling, calculus, fixed prosthesis, incisive papilla, non-carious lesion, palatine raphe, staining or visible changes without cavitation, temporary restoration, tongue, tooth coloured filling, visible changes with cavitation, visible changes with microcavitation

DETECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify each visible tooth and dental condition
2. For EACH feature, draw a tight bounding box around it
3. Measure the box position as percentages of image dimensions (0-100%)
4. Report coordinates with HIGH PRECISION (use decimals: 45.7%, not 45%)

BOUNDING BOX FORMAT: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]
- x_min: left edge position (%)
- y_min: top edge position (%)
- x_max: right edge position (%)
- y_max: bottom edge position (%)
- USE DECIMAL VALUES for accuracy (e.g., 23.5, 47.8, 65.2)

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- high: clearly visible, no ambiguity
- medium: visible but some uncertainty
- low: barely visible or unclear

Return ONLY valid JSON array with precise measurements:
[
  {"class": "tooth_number_or_condition", "bbox": [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max], "confidence": "high/medium/low"}
]

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
[
  {"class": "48", "bbox": [15.3, 22.7, 28.9, 51.2], "confidence": "high"},
  {"class": "calculus", "bbox": [31.5, 48.2, 39.7, 56.8], "confidence": "medium"}
]

Prioritize visible pathologies, then teeth. Maximum 15 most significant detections.
